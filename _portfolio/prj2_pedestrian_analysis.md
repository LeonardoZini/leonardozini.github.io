Development of a Computer Vision pipeline for analyzing pedestrians in public environments. The aims of the project is to detect and track people in a video, check their identity with a database of filed subjects, and increase the accuracy in retrieval with the support of Super Resolution methods, especially when a person in the image is far from the camera.
This project has been developed in collaboration with Giovanni Casari and Pietro Martinello.
