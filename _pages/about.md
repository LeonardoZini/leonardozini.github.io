I am Leonardo Zini, an MSc graduate in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia with a grade of 110/110 with honours. I am focused on analyzing and using Computer Vision and Deep Learning models. I am excited about what AI could achieve and its upcoming changes, with an eye to its transparency.
I also have interests in Computer science-related fields, like cybersecurity and quantum AI, 
which particularly attracts my attention.
Currently, I am working on Instance Segmentation and Image Inpainting.

Outside the lab, I take care of my mental well-being, in a large vastity of ways. Music, human relations, books, and deep conversation keep my brain alive.
